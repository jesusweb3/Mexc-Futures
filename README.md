## 🔎 How It Works (General Description)

The script uses a private signing method to circumvent the exchange’s futures trading restrictions. Thanks to **special headers** and a **unique hashing scheme**, orders are correctly recognized by the exchange as “permitted” for execution.

1. **Preparation**: You receive a unique script and authorize using your key.  
2. **Order Setup**: Specify the trading pair (`symbol`), order type, desired volume, leverage, etc.  
3. **Submission**: The script generates a “bypass” request and sends it to the exchange’s private endpoint.  
4. **Result**: You receive a response confirming your order placement (or an error if something goes wrong).
